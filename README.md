How to Cancel Your Promise

In ES2015, new version of EcmaScript, standard of JavaScript, we got new asynchronous primitive Promise. 
It is a very powerful concept, which allows us to avoid notoriously famous callback hell. 

But, as soon it was discovered, you can not cancel a promise, and this is a real problem. 
Sometimes you have to cancel something, and you need to build a workaround â€“ the amount of work depends 
how often do you need this functionality.

Hope the code snippets helps !!!
